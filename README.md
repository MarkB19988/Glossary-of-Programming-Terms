### Glossary of Programming Terms


##### 1. Algorithm

  An algorithm is a set of (mathematiacal) instructions that are used to complete a task or to solve a problem
   
##### 2. Programming Paradigms

  ###### Procedural Paradigm
   
  Procedural programming is the idea/concept of using procedures. A procedure (also knows as a routine) is a set of commands that can be called from any point in the program (including being called from other procedures)
  
  Procedural programming is very common to see, especially in larger projects as it has the following benefits:
  * Re-Using sections of code without re-typing it
  * Easy to follow the structure and logic of the program
  * The Code is easier to edit and maintain
  
  ###### Object Oriented Paradigm
   
  Object oriented programming is the idea/concept of using objects that can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of methods. A key feature of objects is that they can aceess and edit the data fields of other objects that they are linked to.
  
  ###### Event Driven Paradigm
   
  Event Driven programming is idea/concept that the program will run by recting to user inputs. It can react to different kinds of input, like a button click, choosing from a drop down list, entering text into a text box, and many other kinds of inputs.
  
  ##### 3. Debugging Process
  
  In software development, debugging is the act of locating and fixing any errors in your code. Debugging is a key aspect of software testing and is an essential part of software development in general. The process of debugging starts as soon as the fist lines of code are written and continues to grow as more code is written and begins to take the form of a full software program. In a large program that has thousands of lines of code, the process of debugging can be made simpler and quicker by using strategies such as unit tests, code reviews and pair programming.

  ##### 4. Advantages of using an IDE
  
  Using an IDE has many advantages over using a normal text editor. Firstly, a normal text editor has no way to assist you if you were to make a spelling or a syntax error. When using an IDE, it can have the language you are writing in stored so that it can predidct what you are trying to type and offer you a possible end to your line of code. It can also tell you when it is expecting to see a ; or other syntax and tell you what line it is missing from. 
  
  Another advantage of using an IDE is that most IDE's have a way to run your code built into the software itself, this can save time on having to run your code in another program.
 
  ##### 5. Why Coding Standards Are Important
  
  Coding standards refer to the different ways in which you can wirte code that doesn't impact how the code itself runs, coding standards are cosmetic only. 
  
  As a team, using the same coding standard is important to keep your code consistent.
