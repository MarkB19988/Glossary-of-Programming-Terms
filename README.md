### Glossary of Programming Terms


##### 1. Algorithm

##### 2. Programming Paradigms

  ###### Procedural Paradigm
   
  Procedural programming is the idea/concept of using procedures. A procedure (also knows as a routine) is a set of commands that can be called from any point in the program (including being called from other procedures)
  
  Procedural programming is very common to see, especially in larger projects as it has the following benefits:
  * Re-Using sections of code without re-typing it
  * Easy to follow the structure and logic of the program
  * The Code is easier to edit and maintain
  
  ###### Object Oriented Paradigm
   
  Object oriented programming is the idea/concept of using objects that can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of methods. A key feature of objects is that they can aceess and edit the data fields of other objects that they are linked to.
  
  ###### Event Driven Paradigm
   
  Object oriented programming is the idea/concept of using objects that can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of methods. A key feature of objects is that they can aceess and edit the data fields of other objects that they are linked
